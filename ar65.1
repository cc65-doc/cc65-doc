.SH NAME
ar65 \- an archiver for objects files genrated by ca65
.SH SYNOPSIS
ar65 \fIOPERATION...\fR lib file|module ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
It allows archive creation, addition or removal of modules from archives, and to extract
modules from existing archives.
.SH OPERATIONS
Supported operations:

.IP \fBr\fR
Add modules

You may add modules to a library using the 'r' command ('a' is deprecated). If
the library does not exist, it is created (and a warning message is printed
which you may ignore if creation of the library was your intention). You may
specify any number of modules on the command line following the library.

If a module with the same name exists in the library, it is replaced by the new
one. The archiver prints a warning, if the module in the library has a newer
timestamp than the one to add.

Here's an example:

.in +1i
ar65 r mysubs.lib sub1.o sub2.o
.in

This will add two modules to the library 'mysubs.lib' creating the library if
necessary. If the library contains modules named sub1.o or sub2.o, they are
replaced by the new ones.

Modules names in the library are stored without the path, so, using

.in +1i
ar65 v v r mysubs.lib ofiles/sub1.o ofiles/sub2.o
.in

will verbose add two modules named 'sub1.o' and 'sub2.o' to the library.

.IP \fBd\fR
Delete modules

Deleting modules from a library is done with the 'd' command. You may not give a
path when naming the modules.

Example:

.in +1i
ar65 d mysubs.lib sub1.o
.in

This will delete the module named 'sub1.o' from the library, printing an error
if the library does not contain that module.

.IP \fBt\fR
List library table

The 't' command prints a table of all modules in the library ('l' is
deprecated). Any module names on the command line are ignored.

Example:

.in +1i
ar65 tv mysubs.lib
.in

.IP \fBv\fR
Increase verbosity (put before oether operation)

.IP \fBx\fR
Extract modules

.IP \fBV\fR
Print the archiver version

Using the 'x' command, you may extract modules from the library. The modules
named on the command line are extracted from the library and put into the
current directory.

\fINote\fR: Because of the indexing done by the archiver, the modules may have a
changed binary layout, that is, a binary compare with the old module (before
importing it into the library) may yield differences. The extracted modules are
accepted by the linker and archiver, however, so this is not a problem.

Example for extracting a module from the library:

.in +1i
ar65 x mysubs.lib sub1.o
.in

.P
In addition to these operations, the archiver will check for, and warn about
duplicate external symbols in the library, every time when an operation does
update the library. This is only a warning, the linker will ignore one of the
duplicate symbols (which one is unspecified).
