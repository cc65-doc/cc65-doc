.Sh DESCRIPTION
od65 is an object file dump utility. It is able to output
most parts of object files generated by
.Xr ca65 1
in readable form.  Since the contents and format of the
object files are not documented elsewhere and may change at
any time, this tool is a portable way to look at the
contents.
.Pp
Apart from curiosity, most people don't need to use this
tool.
